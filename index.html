            <h3>Castle on the hill</h3>
                <p>When I was six years old, I broke my leg
                    I was running from my brother and his friends<br>
                    And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
                    I was younger then, take me back to when I</p>
                <p>I'm on my way
                    Driving at 90 down those country lanes
                    Singing to Tiny Dancer,<br>
                    And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
                    When we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill</p>
                <p>Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
                    Running from the law through the backfields and
                    Getting drunk with my friends <br>
                    Had my first kiss on a Friday night
                    I don't reckon that I did it right, but</p>
                <p>I was younger then, take me back to when
                    We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
                    We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight <br>
                    Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long
                    Oh, how we've grown, but I can't wait to go home</p>
                <p>I'm on my way
                    Driving at 90 down those country lanes
                    Singing to Tiny Dancer
                    And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real <br>
                    When we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
                    Over the castle on the hill
                    Over the castle on the hill</p>
                <p>One friend left to sell clothes
                    One works down by the coast
                    One had two kids, but lives alone
                    One's brother overdosed <br>
                    One's already on his second wife
                    One's just barely getting by, but
                    These people raised me
                    And I can't wait to go home</p>
                <p>And I'm on my way
                    I still remember these old country lanes
                    When we did not know the answers
                    And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real <br>
                    When we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
                    Over the castle on the hill
                    Over the castle on the hill</p>
